Drag to continuously move the (currently active) gravity object.\r\n\r\nRight Click \t\t- Disable/enable the (currently active) gravity object.\r\n\r\nCtrl + Left Drag \t- Rotate the camera.\r\nCtrl + Right Drag\t- Pan the camera.\r\nCtrl + Mouse Wheel\t- Zoom the camera in or out.\r\nCtrl + R\t\t- Reset camera.\r\n\r\nSpacebar\t\t- Pause/Resume the simulation.\r\nF11\t\t\t- Toggle fullscreen.\r\n\r\n##For Enthusiasts\t\r\n\r\nNumPad Numbers \t- Change particle colours.\r\n\r\nShift + Arrow Keys\t- Change the number of particles. Press Enter to confirm.\r\nEnter/Return Key\t- Confirm the number of particles, and re-initialize the system.\r\n\r\nKeyboard Numbers\t- Set a gravity object as the active one. Default is 1.\r\n\r\nBackspace\t\t- Turn off all gravity objects.\r\nCtrl + Backspace\t- Turn off all gravity objects, and return their values to defaults.\r\n\r\n##Fine Details\t\r\nFor the following, when arrow keys are used, up/down arrows increment by small amounts, and left/right arrows increment by large amounts. The mouse wheel can also be used.\r\n\r\nA + Arrow Keys\t- Change alpha value of the particles. Low alpha gives smoke-like effects.\r\nC + Arrow Keys \t- Change cohesiveness. Particle acceleration is calculated based on how far it is from gravity objects. If a particle gets very far away, it can take a very long time to come back, or might stop entirely. Cohesiveness sets a cutoff distance after which a constant acceleration is used. The cohesiveness value itself is this cutoff distance squared.\r\nG + Arrow Keys\t- Change the gravity force. Setting this as negative pushes particles away.\r\nP + Arrow Keys\t- Change point size. This is more interesting with smaller numbers of particles.\r\nZ + Arrow Keys\t- Change camera zoom.\r\n\r\nC + R/G/B/Backspace - Set background colour to red/green/blue/black.\r\nAlt + Mouse Wheel \t- Change the depth at which to place the gravity object.\r\nAlt + R\t\t- Reset the depth to default.\r\n\r\nL Key\t\t\t- Write gravity object information to console.",
